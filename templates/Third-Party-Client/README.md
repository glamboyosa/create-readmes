# Adding SIM Swap Detection to your React Native Firebase Apps with Firebase Auth & tru.ID SIMCheck

## Requirements

- A [tru.ID Account](https://tru.id)
- A [**provider** Account]("https://linktoprovider.com)
- A mobile phone with a SIM card and mobile data connection
- Other requirements

## Getting Started

Clone the starter-files branch via:

```bash
git clone -b starter-files --single-branch https://github.com/tru-ID/{repo-name}.git
```

If you're only interested in the finished code in main then run:

git clone -b main https://github.com/tru-ID/{repo-name}.git

Create a [tru.ID Account](https://tru.id)

Install the tru.ID CLI via:

```bash
npm i -g @tru_id/cli

```

Input your **tru.ID** credentials which can be found within the tru.ID [console](https://developer.tru.id/console)

Install the **tru.ID** CLI [development server plugin](https://github.com/tru-ID/cli-plugin-dev-server)

Create a new **tru.ID** project within the root directory via:

```
tru projects:create {project-name}
```

Run the development server, pointing it to the directly containing the newly created project configuration. This will also open up a localtunnel to your development server making it publicly accessible to the Internet so that your mobile phone can access it when only connected to mobile data.

```
tru server -t --project-dir ./{project-name}
```
